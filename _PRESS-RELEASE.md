There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  > A NFL football pick em' application where users battle with others to see who can make the most correct picks for the current week's NFL games.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  > Sports gambling has quickly taken over the sports industry. Sports fans are more interested than ever in which team will win and how much money they can win by predicting that team to win.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  >When a user visits the application they will have a chance to make their prediction picks public and show off how knowledgeable they are on  the NFL. Their knowledge will be put to the test against their friends and family as they battle for bragging rights at the next
  gathering. The user must make a pick for each game schedules for the week and the results of their picks will either add to their point total or keep them near the bottom for that week. While the games are happening on Thursdays,Sundays, and Mondays, users will be able to join a chat room in the app and talk some smack or voice their support for others. Win, lose, or middle of the pack, users will be itching to come back next week to defend or revenge last week's results.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  > Products similar to PickSitch do not have ways for users to connect and chat within the application. This product aims to solve the issue of just making picks and not logging back onto the application after all the game are over on Monday night.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  > While the games are live, users are enccouraged to interact with each other on the chat field, where they will talk smack or provide support based on their's, their brother's or thier sister's picks, all while keeping up to date with the leaderboard.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  > "PickSitch will electrify you for the upcoming NFL week like never before!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  > Head on over to PickSitch.com, where all you need to do to get started is enter a username and a new name for each entry. From there, jump right into making your selections and adding your entry to the leaderboard list and watch your name skyrocket to the top.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  > "PickSitch is super easy and fun! I like that I can connect and keep in touch with my friends living in different cities. We are able to chill and chat while we all watch from our own couch on Sundays."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  > Dare to dive in and prove you are the best out there at picking the situation!
